# xmlLib

A utility to support modification of XML files.

The initial purpose of this project was to support making changes to an existing
Spring Framework project, which uses XML configuration files. As new development adds, 
modifies or removes elements in the Spring XML configuration file, an easy way to 
merge those changes into prior deployments was needed.
